# yt-pants

Changes the "Videos" tab of a youtube channel into the "Pants" tab.
Runs every 500ms on every youtube page (three times on every youtube page for my system for some reason). Use it on your own risk, it may slow down older computers.

## usage
add the raw file URL to `userResourcesLocation`

#### to enable it for all channels
put `youtube.com##+js(yt-pants)` into your filters

#### to enable it for a spesific channel
put `youtube.com##+js(yt-pants, PirateSoftware)` to set it to the chanel @PirateSoftware (you can change this to any channel name, just use the url of the channel not the username)
